## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

I generally use a template when developing CLI applications for myself. I want to share that same template with you, in an easy to use bootstrapper that mirrors the simplicity of starting a new application with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Thus, **create-cli-application** was born.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

- Node
- NPM

### Installing

`npm install -g create-cli-application`

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

`create-cli-application cool-app-name`

### Changing the Source Language

By deafault, **create-cli-application** will create your application as a JavaScript project. You can pass the `--typescript` flag to create a TypeScript project instead.

`create-cli-application cool-app-name --typescript`

Want support for an additional language? Feel free to open a [new issue](https://github.com/alexlee-dev/create-cli-application/issues/new).
